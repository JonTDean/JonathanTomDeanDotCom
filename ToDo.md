# To Do List
Text Kanban.

-----

## Application Global 
- [ ] Establish a theme and color scheme for the application.
- [ ] Establish a technology stack for the application.
- [ ] Get to V1.0.0.


### Theme 
[MD Link](./Theme.md)
- [ ] I need to fill in the color profile and font profile.
  - [x] Primary Colors
  - [ ] Alt Colors
  - [x] Primary Fonts
  - [x] Alt Fonts
- [x] I need to fill in the radius for the components.



### Technology Incorporation
- [ ] Tailwind interactions are required. Adding plugins for further extensions and external libraries is necessary.
- [ ] For the frontend portion of the application I need to incorporate a state mechanism such as Redux/MobX for the application. This will allow for the application to be more dynamic and responsive.
- [ ] In terms of analytics I need to identify what is the best opensource and safe solution to use that does not infringe on my/user privacy.

## Frontend
### Navbar
- [ ] Reduce the height of the Navbar Container, we can find this in the NavbarList Padding.
- [ ] Reduce the Size of the Projects and Contact text to fit better in respect to RMOs default size.
- [ ] Reduce the total size of the Social Media Icons.

### Landing Page
#### CTA
- [ ] Shorten the height of the Spacing between the components within the CTA.
- [ ] Add software proficiency as a separate item to the CTA. This way we can add Git, Docker, and more.
##### Header
- [ ] Reduce the size of the Header CTA Text as RMOs default size is insane.
##### Grabber
- [ ] Re-organize the CTA Components to fit into a single row. As There is too much whitespace around the center image at the moment.
- [ ] For my center picture I need to reduce the border size as it's a little chunky.
- [ ] I need to re-evaulate what roundedness will occur and where as the current situation for the image border looks off and design wise very unappealing.
##### Contracts
- [ ] Add real world contracts you've done with descriptions, dates, and an example of what you did as well as what the application performed. 
- [ ] Add Icons to the Contracts if applicable else add a Contract Icon as the default.
